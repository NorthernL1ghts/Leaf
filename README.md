# Leaf

**The compiler for the Leaf programming language.**

A from-scratch compiler project — no grand plan, just building a compiler because it sounds like fun.

## What’s the idea?

Leaf will take source code and turn it into something runnable: either native code (e.g. x86_64) or by transpiling to another language (e.g. C) and compiling that. The path is still open.

## Project layout

- **`docs/`** — design notes, TODO, and other documentation.
